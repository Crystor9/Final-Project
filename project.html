  <!-- Title: Project Overview -->
  <h1>Project Overview</h1>
  <p>The website uses data drawn from Spotify and provides plots and tables
     displaying the top 10 tracks and related artists upon selecting individual
      artist and year range. The purpose of this website is to visualize how
       artists are categorized and connected to each other and how tracks of
        different artists are rated on a digital music service like Spotify.</p>
  <!-- Section: Audience -->
  <h2>Audience</h2>
  <p>Music is loved and heard by the majority of the population in this world.
     Inevitably some tunes tend to be loved and heard numerous times. Our
      targeted audience are those who love popular tunes and artists, who can
       search up some top tracks and find artists similar to their favorite ones
        using our web app.</p>
  <!-- Section: Data -->
  <h2>Data</h2>
  <p>We worked with 2 libraries for this website from the Spotify libraries. The
     top track library returns a list of information about the top 10 tracks of
      the selected artist, which we selected some features to be used in the
       visualizations. The other library returns data of artists who are similar
        to the selected artist. The Spotify libraries can be found here:
         <a href="https://beta.developer.spotify.com/console/">Spotify API
            Libraries</a></p>
  <!-- Section: Questions -->
  <h2>Questions</h2>
  <p>Some questions that can be answered using our data included:
    <ul>
      <li>For a particular artist, which track has the highest popularity out of
         the top 10 tracks?</li>
      <li>Who are some of the artists that are similar to Taylor Swift on
         Spotify? (based on the community's listening history)</li>
      <li>How many tracks were released from years 2015 to 2017?</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <!-- Section: Structure -->
  <h2>Structure</h2>
  <p>The next 2 tabs display varied visualizations with respect to the Spotify
     data. The first tab displays Top Tracks by a particular artist within a
      time period range according to the user. The second tab allows the user to
       find artists similar to their favorite ones based on certain factors like
        popularity or number of followers, which then can be viewed by the user.
